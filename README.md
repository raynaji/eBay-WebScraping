# eBay-WebScraping

In this project, I web-scraped both sponsored and non-sponsored "playstation 4 slim" items on eBay website.

After obtaining the information of "seller name, seller score, item price, # items sold, best offer available, title, returns allowed, shipping price, condition", I created a local database to store all these information. 

With some further statistical analysis using SQL, I identified some features of differentiating sponsored and non-sponsored items.
