# eBay-WebScraping
In this project, I web-scraped both sponsored and non-sponsored "playstation 4 slim" items on eBay website. I fetched information like sellers, shipping services, item prices of those items and stored them into a local database. Finally, I identified the features of sponsored and non-sponsored items for differentiation.
